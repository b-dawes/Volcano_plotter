# Volcano Plotter

Volcano Plotter is an R Shiny app that allows you to quickly and interactively generate plots from the results of differential expression analyses. Volcano Plotter can generate volcano plots, MA plots, and gene abundance plots. Significance thresholds can be set based on false discovery rate (FDR), gene abundance in log transformed counts per million (logCPM) or log transformed fold change (logFC). Important genes and sets of genes can be highlighted in the plots. Significant genes are also displayed in an interactive table. Both plots and tables can be downloaded in several common formats. 

The app is hosted at: https://bdawes.shinyapps.io/volcano_plotter/
